Thanks for thinking about helping out, that's :metal:

## Getting Started

Once you've cloned the repo you should see all of the tests passing
when you run these commands:

    npm install && npm test

There are automatic builds executed on travis-ci.org over here:
https://travis-ci.org/jedcn/hipchat-hotline

Any pull request you open will go through these checks as well.
